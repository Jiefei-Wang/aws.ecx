\arguments{
\item{LocalGatewayId}{List.   One or more filters.[optional]}

\item{Filter}{Named list where the name is the filter name and the value is the
filter's value. The value can be a vector or a list object (see below)[optional]}

\item{MaxResults}{Integer. The maximum number of results to return with a single call.[optional]}

\item{NextToken}{Characters. The token for the next page of results[optional]}

\item{DryRun}{Logical. Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,...[optional]}

\item{simplify}{Logical. Whether to simplify the result and handle \code{nextToken}
in the response[optional]}

\item{others}{Named list. The parameters that are not included in the
function parameters and need to be added into the request[optional]}

\item{print_on_error}{Logical. Whether to show an error message when a
network error occurs.}

\item{retry_time}{Integer. Number of retries for a REST request when encounter the

\description{
Describes one or
more local gateways. By default, all local gateways are described.
Alternatively, you can filter the results.
}
\section{LocalGatewayId}{


One or more filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{local-gateway-id} - The ID of a local gateway.
\item \code{local-gateway-route-table-id} - The ID of the local gateway route
table.
\item \code{local-gateway-route-table-virtual-interface-group-association-id} -
The ID of the association.
\item \code{local-gateway-route-table-virtual-interface-group-id} - The ID of
the virtual interface group.
\item \code{outpost-arn} - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.
\item \code{state} - The state of the association.
}
}

\section{Filter}{

One or more filters.
}

\section{MaxResults}{

The
maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve the
remaining results, make another call with the returned \code{nextToken}
value.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the required
permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and
provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the
error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is
\code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
