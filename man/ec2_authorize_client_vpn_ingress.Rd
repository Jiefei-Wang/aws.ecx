\description{
Adds an ingress authorization rule to a Client VPN
endpoint. Ingress authorization rules act as firewall rules that grant
access to networks. You must configure ingress authorization rules to
enable clients to access resources in AWS or on-premises
networks.
}
\section{ClientVpnEndpointId}{

The ID of the Client VPN
endpoint.
}

\section{TargetNetworkCidr}{

The IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation,
of the network for which access is being
authorized.
}

\section{AccessGroupId}{

The ID of the group to grant access to,
for example, the Active Directory group or identity provider (IdP)
group. Required if \code{AuthorizeAllGroups} is \code{false} or not
specified.
}

\section{AuthorizeAllGroups}{

Indicates whether to grant access to all
clients. Specify \code{true} to grant all clients who successfully establish
a VPN connection access to the network. Must be set to \code{true} if
\code{AccessGroupId} is not specified.
}

\section{Description}{

A brief
description of the authorization rule.
}

\section{ClientToken}{

Unique,
case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of
the request. For more information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html}{How to Ensure Idempotency}.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks
whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
