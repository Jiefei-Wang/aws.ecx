\arguments{
\item{CapacityReservationId}{Character. The ID of the Capacity Reservation.}

\item{NextToken}{Characters. The token for the next page of results[optional]}

\item{MaxResults}{Integer. The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page.[optional]}

\item{DryRun}{Logical. Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,...[optional]}

\item{simplify}{Logical. Whether to simplify the result and handle \code{nextToken}
in the response[optional]}

\item{others}{Named list. The parameters that are not included in the
function parameters and need to be added into the request[optional]}

\item{print_on_error}{Logical. Whether to show an error message when a
network error occurs.}

\item{retry_time}{Integer. Number of retries for a REST request when encounter the
network issue. If the request has been sent \code{retry_time} times but still not
be able to get the response, an error will be thrown.}

\item{network_timeout}{Numeric. Number of seconds to wait for a REST response
until giving up. Can not be less than 1 ms.}

\section{CapacityReservationId}{

The ID of the Capacity

\section{MaxResults}{

The maximum number of results to
return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be
seen by sending another request with the returned \code{nextToken} value.

}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether
