\arguments{
\item{maxResults}{Character. Pagination limit[optional]}

\item{nextToken}{Characters. The token for the next page of results[optional]}

\item{familyPrefix}{Character. The full family name with which to filter the \code{ListTaskDefinitions} results.}

\item{status}{Character. The task definition status with which to filter the \code{ListTaskDefinitions} results.}

\item{sort}{Character. The order in which to sort the results.}

\item{simplify}{Logical. Whether to simplify the result and handle \code{nextToken}
in the response[optional]}

\item{others}{Named list. The parameters that are not included in the
function parameters and need to be added into the request[optional]}

\item{print_on_error}{Logical. Whether to show an error message when a
network error occurs.}

\item{retry_time}{Integer. Number of retries for a REST request when encounter the
network issue. If the request has been sent \code{retry_time} times but still not
be able to get the response, an error will be thrown.}

\item{network_timeout}{Numeric. Number of seconds to wait for a REST response
until giving up. Can not be less than 1 ms.}

\value{
A list object or a character vector
}
\description{
Returns a list of task definitions that are
registered to your account. You can filter the results by family name
with the \code{familyPrefix} parameter or by status with the \code{status}
parameter.
}
\section{maxResults}{

Pagination
limit
}

\section{familyPrefix}{

The full
family name with which to filter the \code{ListTaskDefinitions} results.
Specifying a \code{familyPrefix} limits the listed task definitions to task
definition revisions that belong to that family.
}

\section{status}{

The
task definition status with which to filter the \code{ListTaskDefinitions}
results. By default, only \code{ACTIVE} task definitions are listed. By
setting this parameter to \code{INACTIVE}, you can view task definitions that
are \code{INACTIVE} as long as an active task or service still references
them. If you paginate the resulting output, be sure to keep the \code{status}
value constant in each subsequent request.
}

\section{sort}{

The order
in which to sort the results. Valid values are \code{ASC} and \code{DESC}. By
default (\code{ASC}), task definitions are listed lexicographically by family
name and in ascending numerical order by revision so that the newest
task definitions in a family are listed last. Setting this parameter to
\code{DESC} reverses the sort order on family name and revision so that the
newest task definitions in a family are listed
first.
