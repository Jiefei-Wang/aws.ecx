\description{
Adds a route to a network to a Client
VPN endpoint. Each Client VPN endpoint has a route table that describes
the available destination network routes. Each route in the route table
specifies the path for tra_c to speci_c resources or
networks.
}
\section{ClientVpnEndpointId}{

The ID of the Client VPN
endpoint to which to add the route.
}

\section{DestinationCidrBlock}{


The IPv4 address range, in CIDR notation, of the route destination. For
example:
\itemize{
\item To add a route for Internet access, enter \verb{0.0.0.0/0}
\item To add a route for a peered VPC, enter the peered VPC\'s IPv4 CIDR
range
\item To add a route for an on-premises network, enter the AWS
Site-to-Site VPN connection\'s IPv4 CIDR range
\item To add a route for the local network, enter the client CIDR range
}
}

\section{TargetVpcSubnetId}{


The ID of the subnet through which you want to route traffic. The
specified subnet must be an existing target network of the Client VPN
endpoint.

Alternatively, if you\'re adding a route for the local network, specify
\code{local}.
}

\section{Description}{

A brief description of the
route.
}

\section{ClientToken}{

Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you
provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information,
see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html}{How to Ensure Idempotency}.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks
whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
