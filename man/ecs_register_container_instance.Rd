Register Container Instance

\section{cluster}{

The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
of the cluster with which to register your container instance. If you do
not specify a cluster, the default cluster is
assumed.
}

\section{instanceIdentityDocument}{

The instance identity document for the EC2
instance to register. This document can be found by running the
following command from the instance:
\verb{curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document/}
}

\section{instanceIdentityDocumentSignature}{

The instance identity document signature for the
EC2 instance to register. This signature can be found by running the
following command from the instance:
\verb{curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/signature/}
}

\section{totalResources}{

The resources available on the
instance.
}

\section{versionInfo}{

The version information for the Amazon ECS
container agent and Docker daemon running on the container
instance.
}

\section{containerInstanceArn}{

The ARN of the container instance (if it
was previously registered).
}

\section{attributes}{

The container instance
attributes that this container instance
supports.
}

\section{platformDevices}{

The devices that are available on the
container instance. The only supported device type is a
GPU.
}

\section{tags}{


The metadata that you apply to the container instance to help you
categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
\itemize{
\item Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
\item For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.
\item Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
\item Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
\item If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
characters: + - = . _ : / @.
\item Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
\item Do not use \verb{aws:}, \verb{AWS:}, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for AWS
use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix.
Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource
limit.
