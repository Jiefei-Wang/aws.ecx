\section{Filter}{


One or more filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{availability-zone} - The Availability Zone for which prices should
be returned.
\item \code{instance-type} - The type of instance (for example, \code{m3.medium}).
\item \code{product-description} - The product description for the Spot price
(\code{Linux/UNIX} \| \verb{Red Hat Enterprise Linux} \| \verb{SUSE Linux} \|
\code{Windows} \| \verb{Linux/UNIX (Amazon VPC)} \|
\verb{Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Amazon VPC)} \| \verb{SUSE Linux (Amazon VPC)}
\| \verb{Windows (Amazon VPC)}).
\item \code{spot-price} - The Spot price. The value must match exactly (or use
wildcards; greater than or less than comparison is not supported).
\item \code{timestamp} - The time stamp of the Spot price history, in UTC
format (for example, \emph{YYYY}-\emph{MM}-\emph{DD}T\emph{HH}:\emph{MM}:\emph{SS}Z). You can use
wildcards (\* and ?). Greater than or less than comparison is not
supported.
}
}

\section{AvailabilityZone}{

Filters the results by the specified Availability
Zone.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the required
permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and
provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the
error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is
\code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
}

\section{EndTime}{

The date and time, up to
the current date, from which to stop retrieving the price history data,
in UTC format (for example,
\emph{YYYY}-\emph{MM}-\emph{DD}T\emph{HH}:\emph{MM}:\emph{SS}Z).
}

\section{InstanceType}{

Filters the
results by the specified instance types.
}

\section{MaxResults}{

The maximum
number of results to return in a single call. Specify a value between 1
and 1000. The default value is 1000. To retrieve the remaining results,
make another call with the returned \code{NextToken}
value.
}

\section{ProductDescription}{

Filters the results by the specified basic
product descriptions.
}

\section{StartTime}{

The date and time, up to the
past 90 days, from which to start retrieving the price history data, in
UTC format (for example,
\emph{YYYY}-\emph{MM}-\emph{DD}T\emph{HH}:\emph{MM}:\emph{SS}Z).
