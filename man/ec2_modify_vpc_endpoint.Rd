\description{
Modifies attributes of a specified VPC
endpoint. The attributes that you can modify depend on the type of VPC
endpoint (interface, gateway, or Gateway Load Balancer). For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html}{VPC Endpoints}
in the \emph{Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User
Guide}.
}
\section{VpcEndpointId}{

The ID of the endpoint.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks
whether you have the required permissions for the action, without
actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have
the required permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}.
Otherwise, it is \code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
}

\section{ResetPolicy}{

(Gateway
endpoint) Specify \code{true} to reset the policy document to the default
policy. The default policy allows full access to the
service.
}

\section{PolicyDocument}{

(Interface and gateway endpoints) A policy
to attach to the endpoint that controls access to the service. The
policy must be in valid JSON format.
}

\section{AddRouteTableId}{

(Gateway
endpoint) One or more route tables IDs to associate with the
endpoint.
}

\section{RemoveRouteTableId}{

(Gateway endpoint) One or more route table
IDs to disassociate from the endpoint.
}

\section{AddSubnetId}{

(Interface
and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints) One or more subnet IDs in which to
serve the endpoint. For a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, you can
specify only one subnet.
}

\section{RemoveSubnetId}{

(Interface endpoint) One or
more subnets IDs in which to remove the
endpoint.
}

\section{AddSecurityGroupId}{

(Interface endpoint) One or more security
group IDs to associate with the network
interface.
}

\section{RemoveSecurityGroupId}{

(Interface endpoint) One or more security
group IDs to disassociate from the network
interface.
}

\section{PrivateDnsEnabled}{

(Interface endpoint) Indicates whether a
private hosted zone is associated with the VPC.
}
