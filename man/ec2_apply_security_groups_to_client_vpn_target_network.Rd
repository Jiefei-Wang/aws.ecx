\arguments{
\item{ClientVpnEndpointId}{Character. The ID of the Client VPN endpoint.}

\item{VpcId}{Character. The ID of the VPC in which the associated target network is located.}

\item{SecurityGroupId}{List. The IDs of the security groups to apply to the associated target network.}

\item{DryRun}{Logical. Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,...[optional]}

\item{simplify}{Logical. Whether to simplify the result and handle \code{nextToken}
in the response[optional]}

\item{others}{Named list. The parameters that are not included in the
function parameters and need to be added into the request[optional]}

\item{print_on_error}{Logical. Whether to show an error message when a
network error occurs.}

\item{retry_time}{Integer. Number of retries for a REST request when encounter the
network issue. If the request has been sent \code{retry_time} times but still not
be able to get the response, an error will be thrown.}

\item{network_timeout}{Numeric. Number of seconds to wait for a REST response
until giving up. Can not be less than 1 ms.}

\value{

\description{
Applies a security group to the
association between the target network and the Client VPN endpoint. This
action replaces the existing security groups with the specified security
groups.
}
\section{ClientVpnEndpointId}{

The ID of the Client VPN
endpoint.
}

\section{VpcId}{

The ID of the VPC in which the associated
target network is located.
}

\section{SecurityGroupId}{

The IDs of the security
groups to apply to the associated target network. Up to 5 security
groups can be applied to an associated target
network.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the required
permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and
provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the
error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is
\code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
