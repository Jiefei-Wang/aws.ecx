\arguments{
\item{ClientVpnEndpointId}{Character. The ID of the Client VPN endpoint.}

\item{VpcId}{Character. The ID of the VPC in which the associated target network is located.}

\item{simplify}{Logical. Whether to simplify the result and handle \code{nextToken}
in the response[optional]}

\item{others}{Named list. The parameters that are not included in the
function parameters and need to be added into the request[optional]}

\item{print_on_error}{Logical. Whether to show an error message when a
network error occurs.}

\item{retry_time}{Integer. Number of retries for a REST request when encounter the

\description{

}
\section{ClientVpnEndpointId}{

The ID of the Client VPN
endpoint.
}

\section{VpcId}{

The ID of the VPC in which the associated
target network is located.
}

\section{SecurityGroupId}{

The IDs of the security

}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the required
