\description{
Describes your Elastic IP addresses that are being
moved to the EC2-VPC platform, or that are being restored to the
EC2-Classic platform. This request does not return information about any
other Elastic IP addresses in your
account.
}
\section{Filter}{


One or more filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{moving-status} - The status of the Elastic IP address
(\code{MovingToVpc} \| \code{RestoringToClassic}).
}
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the required permissions
for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an
error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response
is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is
\code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
}

\section{MaxResults}{


The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single
page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by
sending another request with the returned \code{NextToken} value. This value
can be between 5 and 1000; if \code{MaxResults} is given a value outside of
this range, an error is returned.

Default: If no value is provided, the default is 1000.
}

\section{PublicIp}{

One or more Elastic IP
addresses.
