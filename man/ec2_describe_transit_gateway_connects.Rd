\description{

attachments.
}
\section{TransitGatewayAttachmentIds}{

The IDs of the
attachments.
}

\section{Filter}{


One or more filters. The possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{options.protocol} - The tunnel protocol (\code{gre}).
\item \code{state} - The state of the attachment (\code{initiating} \|
\code{initiatingRequest} \| \code{pendingAcceptance} \| \code{rollingBack} \|
\code{pending} \| \code{available} \| \code{modifying} \| \code{deleting} \| \code{deleted}
\| \code{failed} \| \code{rejected} \| \code{rejecting} \| \code{failing}).
\item \code{transit-gateway-attachment-id} - The ID of the Connect attachment.
\item \code{transit-gateway-id} - The ID of the transit gateway.
\item \code{transport-transit-gateway-attachment-id} - The ID of the transit
gateway attachment from which the Connect attachment was created.
}
}

\section{MaxResults}{

The maximum number of results to return with a
single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with
the returned \code{nextToken} value.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the
required permissions for the action, without actually making the
request, and provides an error response. If you have the required
permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is
\code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
