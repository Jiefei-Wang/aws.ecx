\section{Filter}{


The filters.
\itemize{
\item \code{instance-family} - The instance family (for example, \code{m4}).
\item \code{payment-option} - The payment option (\code{NoUpfront} \|
\code{PartialUpfront} \| \code{AllUpfront}).
\item \code{state} - The state of the reservation (\code{payment-pending} \|
\code{payment-failed} \| \code{active} \| \code{retired}).
\item \code{tag}:\ - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the
resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as
the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag
with the key \code{Owner} and the value \code{TeamA}, specify \code{tag:Owner} for
the filter name and \code{TeamA} for the filter value.
\item \code{tag-key} - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this
filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key,
regardless of the tag value.
}
}

\section{HostReservationIdSet}{

The host reservation IDs.
}

\section{MaxResults}{

The
maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page.
The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the
returned \code{nextToken} value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If
\code{maxResults} is given a larger value than 500, you receive an
error.
