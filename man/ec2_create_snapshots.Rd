\item{simplify}{Logical. Whether to simplify the result and handle \code{nextToken}
in the response[optional]}

\item{others}{Named list. The parameters that are not included in the
function parameters and need to be added into the request[optional]}

\section{InstanceSpecification}{

The instance to specify
which volumes should be included in the snapshots.
}

\section{Description}{


A description propagated to every snapshot specified by the
instance.
}

\section{OutpostArn}{


The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Outpost on which to create the
local snapshots.
\itemize{
\item To create snapshots from an instance in a Region, omit this
parameter. The snapshots are created in the same Region as the
instance.
\item To create snapshots from an instance on an Outpost and store the
snapshots in the Region, omit this parameter. The snapshots are
created in the Region for the Outpost.
\item To create snapshots from an instance on an Outpost and store the
snapshots on an Outpost, specify the ARN of the destination Outpost.
The snapshots must be created on the same Outpost as the instance.
}

in the \emph{Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide}.
}

\section{TagSpecification}{

Tags to apply to every snapshot specified by the
instance.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the required
permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and
provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the
error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is
\code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
}

\section{CopyTagsFromSource}{

Copies the tags from the
specified volume to corresponding snapshot.
