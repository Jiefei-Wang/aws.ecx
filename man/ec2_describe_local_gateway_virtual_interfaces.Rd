\description{
Describes the specified
local gateway virtual interfaces.
}
\section{LocalGatewayVirtualInterfaceId}{

The IDs of the virtual
interfaces.
}

\section{Filter}{

One or more
filters.
}

\section{MaxResults}{

The maximum number of results to return
with a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call
with the returned \code{nextToken} value.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have
the required permissions for the action, without actually making the
request, and provides an error response. If you have the required
permissions, the error response is \code{DryRunOperation}. Otherwise, it is
\code{UnauthorizedOperation}.
