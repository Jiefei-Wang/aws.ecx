\section{TransitGatewayAttachmentIds}{

The IDs of the

}

\section{Filter}{


One or more filters. The possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{state} - The state of the attachment. Valid values are \code{available}
\| \code{deleted} \| \code{deleting} \| \code{failed} \| \code{failing} \|
\code{initiatingRequest} \| \code{modifying} \| \code{pendingAcceptance} \|
\code{pending} \| \code{rollingBack} \| \code{rejected} \| \code{rejecting}.
\item \code{transit-gateway-attachment-id} - The ID of the attachment.
\item \code{transit-gateway-id} - The ID of the transit gateway.
\item \code{vpc-id} - The ID of the VPC.
}
}

\section{MaxResults}{

The maximum number of results to return with a
single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with
the returned \code{nextToken} value.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the
required permissions for the action, without actually making the
