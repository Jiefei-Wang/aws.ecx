\section{TransitGatewayConnectPeerIds}{

\section{Filter}{


One or more filters. The possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{state} - The state of the Connect peer (\code{pending} \| \code{available} \|
\code{deleting} \| \code{deleted}).
\item \code{transit-gateway-attachment-id} - The ID of the attachment.
\item \code{transit-gateway-connect-peer-id} - The ID of the Connect peer.
}
}

\section{MaxResults}{

The maximum number of results to return with a
single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with
the returned \code{nextToken} value.
}

\section{DryRun}{

Checks whether you have the
required permissions for the action, without actually making the
request, and provides an error response. If you have the required
